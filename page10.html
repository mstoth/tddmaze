Now we have no failures and we can detect walls
in
front of
the turtle.&nbsp; It&#8217;s time to discuss the algorithm for solving the
maze. <br>
      <br>
The algorithm will be recursive.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a pseudo code
implementation. <br>
      <ol>
        <li>If the cheese is in front of the turtle, return true and
play a happy sound. </li>
        <li>Look in all 4 directions around the turtle. </li>
        <li>If you see an empty (white) area travel in that direction
until you get to a branch or a wall, then try to solve the maze in that
direction. (Call the solve method again.)</li>
        <li>If there are no more places to move, return false</li>
        <li>go to the next empty area around the turtle and try that
direction</li>
        <li>If calling solve passes, return true</li>
      </ol>
Understanding this algorithm will give us clues to our next test.&nbsp;
We need to tell the turtle to move to the next spot where it either has
to change direction like when it comes to a bend in the path, or can
change direction like when there is a path to the right or left as well
as straight ahead. <br>
      <br>
A method called travel2BranchOrWall will be useful. This will move the
turtle forward until either it hits a wall or it sees a path to the
right or the left. <br>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left;"> Now write the first
test for
travel2branchorwall. If we
called travel2branchorwall from the starting position, we would expect
to stop at the right-hand turn. Write a test to check if the turtle is
there after calling travel2branchorwall. <br>
